# City Explorer

**Author**: Wajiha Khan

**Version**: 1.0.0

**Overview**:

- This project is a web application designed to explore the integration and utilization of external APIs. APIs provide a powerful mechanism to retrieve data from diverse sources and leverage it within applications. The primary objective of this project is to deepen understanding of API connectivity, data retrieval, and presentation within a web context.

**Getting Started**:

- Estimate of time needed to complete: 3 hours
- Start time: 6:15 pm
- Finish time: 9:25 pm
- Actual time needed to complete: 3 hours and 10 minutes

**Version**: 2.0.0

**Overview**:

- This React application uses APIs to fetch and display weather and movie data based on the users input. Users can input a city name to trigger location search functionality, which fetches location information and displays it. The Weather component displays weather forecasts, and the Movies component fetches and displays movie data for the specified city.

**Getting Started**:

- Set up environment variables
- Implement a function for the movies to fetch movie data based on the entered city using the custom API endpoint.
- Render a movie component

**Architecture**:

- Framework: React
- Styling: Bootstrap
- Dependencies: axios, react-if, react-dom

**Change Log**:

04/03/2024 - 04/04/2024 10:30 pm

- Estimate of time needed to complete: 5 hours
- Start time: 6:30 pm -- Start Time: 6:00 pm 04/04/2024
- Finish time: 10:30 pm
- Actual time needed to complete: 4 hours

**Version**: 2.0.0

**Overview**:

- This application showcases weather forecasts and movie information based on user-provided locations using React and external APIs. To refactor and improve the front-end codebase, the Weather component will incorporate a nested WeatherDay component to render individual forecast days. Similarly, the Movies component will integrate a nested Movie component to handle rendering of movie data. These changes enhance code organization and component reusability, following React best practices for maintainable applications

**Getting Started**:

- Create new components for weather to render individual forecast days. Use mapping to convert the raw response data into an array of new weather component.
- Similarly, create a nested movie component to handle rendering of each individual movie object from the raw response.

**Architecture**:

- Framework: React
- Styling: Bootstrap
- Dependencies: axios, react-if, react-dom

**Change Log**:

- Estimate of time time needed to complete: 2 hours
- start time: 6:20 pm
- Finish time: 7:45 pm
- Actual time needed to complete: An hour and 25 minutes

In summary, this project aims to improve the structure and reusability of the front-end codebase by breaking down complex components into smaller, more focused components. This approach enhances readability, simplifies maintenance, and promotes scalability. Leveraging technologies like React, Bootstrap, Axios, and React Bootstrap ensures a responsive and user-friendly design while integrating seamlessly with external APIs to provide dynamic weather and movie information to users based on their inputs. The project emphasizes best practices in front-end development, including component-based architecture, state management, API integration, error handling, and responsive design.
